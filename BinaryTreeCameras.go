 * Problem proposal extracted from LeetCodeÂ©
 *
 * Binary Tree Cameras
 *
 * Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.
 * Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
 * Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
 *
 * My solution: Very tough problem...At first, the ideia is to start from the bottom of the tree. Then we go way up, and verify the
 *	child nodes. If they are '0' it means there's no camera that have eyes on them. Otherwise, if it's '-1', it means that that spot
 *	needs a camera to monitorate it's children. At last, if there's a '1' as return, a camera has been positioned, so it will force
 *  the program to ignore a superior level, because it already has a camera.
 *
 * (Not included a main function...)
