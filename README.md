| Program File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ArrayRunningSum.go](ArrayRunningSum.go) | Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]). |
| [BinaryTreeCameras.go](BinaryTreeCameras.go) | Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. |
| [DeepestLeavesSum.go](DeepestLeavesSum.go) | Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves. |
| [FirstLastElementsArray.go](FirstLastElementsArray.go) | Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. |
| [JewelsAndStones.go](JumpGame.go) | Given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have, check how many jewels you can find in the stones. |
| [JumpGame.go](JumpGame.go) | Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. |
| [MaxPoints.go](MaxPoints.go) | Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain. |
| [NonDecreasingArray.go](NonDecreasingArray.go) | Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. |
| [PowerOfThree.go](PowerOfThree.go) | Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. |
| [PowerfulIntegers.go](PowerfulIntegers.go) | Given three integers x, y, and bound, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to bound. |
| [Primes.go](Primes.go) | Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n. |
| [ReverseInteger.go](ReverseInteger.go) | Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. |
| [SuperPalindromes.go](SuperPalindromes.go) | Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range |
| [ValidNumber.go](ValidNumber.go) | Given a string s, return true if s is a valid number. |
