 *
 * Custom Sort String
 *
 * order and str are strings composed of lowercase letters. In order, no letter occurs more than once.
 * order was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of str so that they match the order that order 
 *	was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in order, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
 * Return any permutation of str (as a string) that satisfies this property.
 *
 * My solution: Basically, we can count the occurence of each letter by using a hash, and then simply rebuild the string following 
 *	the order, adding the unmapped letters at the end.
