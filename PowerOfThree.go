 * Power of Three
 * Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
 * An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.
 *
 * My Solution: While it's divisable by 3, keep dividing it. At he end, if it's 1, it means the number is a power of three!
