 *
 * Jump Game II
 * Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
 *
 * My Solution: A greedy aproach is capable to solve this problem with a O(n) efficiency. While it iterates
 *	over the array, it keeps tracking the highest possible jump by using math.max.
