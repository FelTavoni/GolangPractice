 * Problem proposal extracted from LeetCodeÂ©
 *
 * Jewels And Stones
 *
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
 * Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 *
 * My solution: Basic solution. For each stone, check if we have a matching jewel.
